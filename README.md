wikipedia-rankings
==================

Support files for [TIME's ranking of the prominent people on Wikipedia](https://time.com/109947/web-ranking/).

Data was collected over several days in May using [node-wikipedia](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-wikipedia), a Node.js module maintained by [@wilson428](https://github.com/wilson428).

We considered eight data points for each entry:

+ Number of words
+ Number of links to other Wikipedia pages
+ Number of external links (which are typically references)
+ Number of categories the person is in
+ Total number of revisions to the page
+ Number of unique individuals who have edited the page as a signed-in editors
+ Number of anonymous edits
+ Number of vandalisms, as identified in editing notes 

Data for the top 100,000-or-so people is available as a [15MB CSV file](/people.csv).

## Analysis

Using out-of-the-box R functions, we reduced these eight variables to their principal components (using [this handy guide](http://little-book-of-r-for-multivariate-analysis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/src/multivariateanalysis.html#principal-component-analysis)). As you can see, a huge amount of the variance is contained in the first PC:

You can rerun the principal component analysis like so:

	RScript wikipedia.r

(This may require installing the relevant libraries first).

By trial and error, the ranking that most satisfied our anecdotal sense for "influence" in the real world was PC1 + PC2, which becomes the `score` for each person.
